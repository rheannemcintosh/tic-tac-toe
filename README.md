# Tic Tac Toe ðŸŽ²
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game which is played on a 3x3 grid by two players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to achieve three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## How was this built?
This version of Tic Tac Toe was built using Laravel as the foundation, integrating MySQL for the database, and employing Tailwind CSS for the styling of the interface. The game itself incorporates Livewire and Pusher, enabling real-time gameplay for an immersive experience.

## How is this hosted?
Laravel Forge was used to ensure a seamless launch.

## What are the limitations?
As this application was developed quickly, there are known limitations that offer potential for enhancement, including:
- [ ] Optimising for mobile devices to ensure a responsive experience across all platforms.
- [ ] Implementing visual indicators to notify users when a player joins or leaves the game.

## What are the possible future improvements?
By using Laravel as the framework, it allows for a scalable solution to easily be made. In the future, various improvements could be implemented, including:
- [ ] Introducing a comprehensive scoring system to track each player's performance.
- [ ] Organising tournaments with dedicated scoreboards to allow friendly competition.
- [ ] Creating user profiles, to allow players to maintain high scores, and to connect with friends.
